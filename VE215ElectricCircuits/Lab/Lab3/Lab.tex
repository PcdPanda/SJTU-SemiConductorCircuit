\subsection{Theoretical Background}
\subsubsection{First-order Circuits}
Theoretically, the transient responses in electric circuits are described by differential equations. The circuits, whose responses obey the first-order differential equation
$$\frac{\mathsf{d}x(t)}{\mathsf{d}t}+\frac{1}{\tau}\cdot x(t)=f(t)$$
are called $\mathbf{first-order circuits}$. Their responses are always monotonic and appear in the form of exponential form
$$x(t)=K_1\cdot e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}+K_2$$
\par A first-order 	circuit includes the effective resistance $R$ and one energy-storage element, an inductor $L$, or a capacitor $C$.
\par In an RC circuit, the time constant is
$$\tau=RC$$
\par In an LC circuit, the time constant is 
$$\tau=\frac{L}{R}$$
\par The $\mathbf{fall time}$ of a signal is defined as the interval between the moment when the signal reaches 90\% and the moment when the signal reaches 10\% level. Note that the 10\% level is reached between $2\tau$ and $3\tau$. Approximately, you can assume the fall time $\approx$ 2.2 $\tau$. After $t=5\tau$, the exponent practically equals zero.
\subsubsection{Second-order Circuits}
Many circuits involve two energy-storing elements, both an inductor $L$ and a capacitor $C$. Such circuits require a second-order differential equation description.
$$\frac{\mathsf{d}^2x(t)}{\mathsf{d}t^2}+2\cdot\alpha\cdot\frac{\mathsf{d}x(t)}{\mathsf{d}t}+\omega_0^2\cdot x(t)=f(t)$$
thus they are called $\mathbf{second-order circuits}$.
\par We will consider only second-order circuits with one inductor and one capacitor. The differential equation includes two parameters: the damping factor $\alpha$ and the undamped frequency $\omega_0$ which are determined by the circuit and its components.
\par For example, in the series RLC circuit, which you will build and study in this lab,
$$\alpha=\frac{R}{2\cdot L},\omega_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{L\cdot C}}$$
\par while in the parallel RLC circuit
$$\alpha=\frac{1}{2\cdot R\cdot C},\omega_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{L\cdot C}}$$
\par Depending on the two parameters $\alpha$ and $\omega_0$, second-order circuits can exhibit three types of response.
\subsubsection{The Underdamped Response}
If $\alpha<\omega_0$
$$x(t)=e^{-\alpha t}(K_1cos(\omega t)+K_2sin(\omega t))$$
where $\omega=\sqrt{\omega_0^2-\alpha^2}$
The underdamped circuit response involves decaying oscillations, which may
last for many periods or for less than one period, depending on the damping
ratio $\xi=\frac{\alpha}{\omega_0}$, which for the series RLC circuit $\xi=\frac{R}{2L}\sqrt{LC}=\frac{R}{2}\cdot\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}$. Varying the values of $R,L,C$, affects the damping ration $\xi$.
\subsubsection{The Critically Damped Response}
if $\alpha=\omega_0$
$$x(t)=e^{-\alpha t}(K_1+K_2t)$$
and the circuit has the critically damped response.
\par The critically damped response does not involve oscillations.
\par For the series RLC circuits,$\alpha=\omega_0$ corresponds to $\frac{R}{2L}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$ or $R=R_{critical}=2\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}$.
\par If $L=1mH and C=10nF,$ then $R_{critical}\approx 632\Omega.$
\subsubsection{The Overdamped Response}
If $\alpha>\omega_0$
$$x(t)=K_1\cdot e^{s_1t}+K_2\cdot e^{s_2t}$$
where $s_1=-\alpha+\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_0^2}$ and $s_2=-\alpha-\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_0^2}$
\par In the series RLC circuits, the overdamped solution is obtained if the resistance is larger than the critical resistance, such that $R>R_{critical}=2\cdot\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}$
\par Notice that the larger resistance corresponds to the longer delay, and even
the faster decay has a much longer fall time than the critically damped response.
\par One of the most interesting features of series RLC circuits is that increasing
the resistance above the critical value results in much longer fall time, or longer
delays of responses in digital circuits. Among all monotonic responses, the
critically damped is the fastest.
\section{Procedure}

\section{Conclusion}
In this lab work, I built series $RC$ and $RLC$ circuits, and studied the step responses on these corresponding first-order and second-order circuits.
\par For the first-order circuit, I measured the rise time and fall time when the circuit has fastest response and slowest response respectively. With the increase of $R_P$ the rise time and fall time is also increasing.
\par When $R_P=0[\Omega]$, which means the circuit has the fastest response, the $V_{ppk}$ of input square wave and output square wave is very close, which is $1.09[V]$. The period of the input square wave $T=10[ms]$, which is equal to the theoretical value $\frac{1}{100\cdot 1000}=0.01[s]$. According to the pre-lab assignment, I calculated $\tau=1\cdot 10^{-4}[s]$, so the theoretical value of rise time and fall time is $2.2\tau=2.2\cdot10^{-4}[s]$, which is very similar to my measured value: $0.219[ms]$ and $0.210[ms]$.
\par When $R_P=10[k\Omega]$, which means the circuit has the fastest response, the $V_{ppk}$ of input square wave and output square wave is not as close as fastest response, which is $1.05[V]$ and $1.11[V]$. The period of the input square wave $T=10[ms]$, which is equal to the theoretical value $\frac{1}{100\cdot 1000}=0.01[s]$. According to the pre-lab assignment, I calculated $\tau=1.1\cdot 10^{-3}[s]$, so the theoretical value of rise time and fall time is $2.2\tau=2.42\cdot10^{-3}[s]$, which is very similar to my measured value: $2.344[ms]$ and $2.218[ms]$.
\par For the second-order circuit, I also measure the rise time and fall time during under-damped, critically damped, and over-damped conditions. Similar to first-order circuit, the rise time and  fall time also becomes bigger as $R_P$ increasing.
\par In pre-lab assignment, I'm asked to use $PSpice$ to build the first-order and second-order circuit to stimulate the waveform, and the results are similar to what I get from the screen.
